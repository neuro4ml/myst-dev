<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>So far this week we’ve seen a lot of biological detail about neurons.
The topic of this section is how we abstract and simplify this into very simple models.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>Note!
In this section, we’ll focus on models without a lot of biological detail like the spatial structure of the neuron, and we’ll come back to that in the next section.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="artificial-neuron">
<h2>Artificial Neuron<a class="headerlink" href="#artificial-neuron" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>You’re probably familiar with the artificial neuron from machine learning.</p>
<p>This neuron has n inputs, which have activations x<sub>1</sub> to x<sub>n</sub> with weights w<sub>1</sub> to w<sub>n</sub>. Each of these activations and weights is a real number.</p>
<p>It performs a weighted sum of its inputs and then passes that through some nonlinear function f.
Various functions can be used here.</p>
<p>In older work you’ll often see the sigmoid function, and that’s partly because it was considered a good model of real neurons.</p>
<p>Nowadays, you’ll more often see the <abbr title="Rectified Linear Unit">ReLU</abbr>, which turns out to be much easier to work with and gives results that are often better.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id1">

<p><span class="caption-text">Models for Artificial Neurons</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Interestingly, there’s still papers being published about what the best model of real neurons’ activation functions, like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.13.557650v1">this one</a> from 2023 which looks a bit intermediate between sigmoid and <abbr title="Rectified Linear Unit">ReLU</abbr>.</p>
<p>The relationship between the model and the biological data is established by computing an input-output function, typically by counting the number of spikes coming in to the neurons versus the number of spikes going out, averaged over multiple runs and some time period.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">

What this model misses out is the <strong>temporal dynamics</strong> of biological neurons.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="biological-neuron">
<h2>Biological Neuron<a class="headerlink" href="#biological-neuron" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>So let’s talk about temporal dynamics. We saw in previous sections that when a neuron receives enough input current it pushes it above a threshold that leads to an action potential, also called a spike.</p>
<p>The source of the input current is incoming spikes from other neurons, and we’ll talk more about that in next week’s sections on synapses.</p>
<p>For this week, <a class="reference internal" href="#ideal"><span class="xref myst">here’s</span></a> a simple, idealised picture of what this looks like. It’s from a model rather than real data, to more clearly illustrate the process.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id2">
<img alt="Idealised Picture of Incoming Spikes" src="../_images/biologicalneuron.png" />
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-text">Idealised Picture of Membrane Potential vs Time</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The curve shows the membrane potential of a neuron receiving input spikes at the times indicated by the red circles. Each incoming spike causes a transient rush of incoming current.</p>
<p>For the first one, it’s not enough to cause the neuron to spike, and after a while the membrane potential starts to decay back to its resting value.</p>
<p>And then, more come in and eventually the cumulative effect is enough to push the neuron above the threshold, and it fires a spike and resets.</p>
</section>
<section id="integrate-and-fire-neuron">
<h2>Integrate and Fire Neuron<a class="headerlink" href="#integrate-and-fire-neuron" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The simplest way to model this is using the “integrate and fire neuron”. <a class="reference internal" href="#integrateandfire"><span class="xref myst">Here’s</span></a> a plot of how it behaves.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id3">
<img alt="Integrate and Fire Model" src="../_images/IF.png" />
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-text">Graph Detailling Behavior of Integrate and Fire Model</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Each time an incoming spike arrives, every 10 milliseconds here, the membrane potential instantaneously jumps by some fixed weight until it hits the threshold, at which point it fires a spike and resets.</p>
<p>We can write this down in a standard form as a series of event-based equations.</p>
<p>Firstly, when you receive an incoming spike:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-rxspike">
<span class="eqno">(1)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-rxspike" title="Link to this equation">¶</a></span>\[v \leftarrow v + w_i\]</div>
<p>Set the variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> to be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v+w_i\)</span>, if the threshold condition (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v &gt; 1\)</span>) is true, fire a spike.</p>
<p>After a spike, set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> to 0.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>Linker
We can see that already this captures part of what’s going on in a real neuron, but misses the fact that in the absence of new inputs, the membrane potential decays back to rest. Let’s add that.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="leaky-integrate-and-fire-lif-neuron">
<h2>Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) Neuron<a class="headerlink" href="#leaky-integrate-and-fire-lif-neuron" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We can model this decay by treating the membrane as a capacitor in an electrical circuit. Turning this into a differential equation, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> evolves over time according to the <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-de">(2)</a></p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-de">
<span class="eqno">(2)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-de" title="Link to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\tau \frac{dv}{dt} = - v\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> is the membrane time constant we discussed in the last section.</p>
<p>This differential equation can be solved to show that in the absence of any input, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> decreases exponentially over time with a time scale of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span>.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#LIF"><span class="xref myst">Here’s</span></a> how that looks:</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can see that after the instantaneous increase in membrane potential it starts to decay back to the resting value. Although this doesn’t look like a great model, it turns out that very often this captures enough of what is going on in real neurons.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>

But there is another reason why adding this leak might be important.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="reliable-spike-timing">
<h2>Reliable Spike Timing<a class="headerlink" href="#reliable-spike-timing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In experiments, if you inject a constant input current (<a class="reference internal" href="#reliable"><span class="xref myst">horizontal line, top left</span></a>) into a neuron and record what happens over a few repeated trials, you see that the membrane potentials (<a class="reference internal" href="#reliable"><span class="xref myst">top left above input current</span></a>) and the spike times (<a class="reference internal" href="#reliable"><span class="xref myst">bottom left</span></a>) are fairly different between trials. That’s because there’s a lot of noise in the brain which adds up over time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you inject a fluctuating input current (<a class="reference internal" href="#reliable"><span class="xref myst">top right</span></a>) and do the same thing, you’ll see both the membrane potentials (<a class="reference internal" href="#reliable"><span class="xref myst">top right, above fluctuating current</span></a>) and the spikes (<a class="reference internal" href="#reliable"><span class="xref myst">bottom right</span></a>) tend to occur at the same times.</p>

<p>The vertical lines on the bottom right plot show that on every repeat, the spike is happening at the same time.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Note
We’ll come back to why this happens in a moment, but first let’s have a look at some models in the same situation.</p>
</div>
<p>We see the same thing with a <abbr title="Leaky Integrate-and-Fire">LIF</abbr> neuron. <a class="reference internal" href="#LIFSpike"><span class="xref myst">Here</span></a> are the plots for the membrane potentials as semi-transparent so that you can clearly see that both the spike times and membrane potentials tend to overlap for the fluctuating current, but not the constant current.</p>

<p><span class="caption-text">LIF Spike Timing Graphs for Constant and Fluctuating Input Current</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But now if we repeat that with a simple integrate and fire neuron without a leak, you can see you get unreliable, random spike times for both the constant and fluctuating currents.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id7">
<img alt="LIF Spike Timing" src="../_images/reliable3.png" />
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-text">LIF Spike Timing Graphs for Constant and Fluctuating Input Current Without a Leak</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In other words, adding the leak made the neuron more robust to noise. An important property for the brain, and perhaps also for low power neuromorphic hardware that we’ll talk about later in the course.</p>
<p>So why does the leak make it more noise robust? Well that was answered by Romain Brette in a <a class="reference external" href="https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article-abstract/15/2/279/6702/Reliability-of-Spike-Timing-Is-a-General-Property?redirectedFrom=fulltext">paper</a> in 2003. The mathematical analysis is complicated, but it boils down to the fact that if you either have a leak, or a nonlinearity in the differential equations, the fluctuations due to the internal noise don’t accumulate over time, whereas with a linear and non-leaky neuron, they do.</p>

<section id="lif-neuron-with-synapses">
<h2><abbr title="Leaky Integrate-and-Fire">LIF</abbr> Neuron with Synapses<a class="headerlink" href="#lif-neuron-with-synapses" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>OK, so we have an <abbr title="Leaky Integrate-and-Fire">LIF</abbr> neuron which we’ve just seen has some nice properties that you’d want a biological neuron model to have. But still, when you look at the picture <a class="reference internal" href="#LIF"><span class="xref myst">here</span></a> in the top right, you can see that these instantaneous jumps in the model are not very realistic. So how can we improve that?</p>
<p>A simple answer is to change the model so that instead of having an instantaneous effect on the membrane potential, instead it has an instantaneous effect on an input current, which is then provided as an input the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron.</p>
<p>You can see on the bottom plot <a class="reference internal" href="#LIFimproved"><span class="xref myst">here</span></a> that the input current is now behaving like the membrane potential before, with this exponential shape. You can think of that as a model of the internal processes of the synapses that we’ll talk more about next week.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id8">
<img alt="LIF Spike Timing Improved" src="../_images/LIFimprov.png" />
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-text">Improved LIF Model</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We model that by adding a <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-de2">(3)</a>, with its own time constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau_I\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-de2">
<span class="eqno">(3)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-de2" title="Link to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\tau_I \frac{dI}{dt} = -I \]</div>
<p>We also add that current <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> to the differential equation for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span> here, multiplied by a constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span>. The rest of the model is as it was before.</p>
<p>We can see that this gives a better approximation of the shape.
There’s more that can be done here if you want, for example modelling changes in conductance rather than current, but we’ll get back to that next week.</p>
</section>
<section id="spike-frequency-adaptation">
<h2>Spike Frequency Adaptation<a class="headerlink" href="#spike-frequency-adaptation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you feed a regular series of spikes into an <abbr title="Leaky Integrate-and-Fire">LIF</abbr> neuron (without any noise) you’ll see that the time between spikes is always the same. It has to be because the differential equation is memoryless and resets after each spike.</p>
<p>However, real neurons have a memory of their recent activity. <a class="reference internal" href="#memory"><span class="xref myst">Here</span></a> are some recordings from the <a class="reference external" href="https://celltypes.brain-map.org/data">Allen Institute cell types database</a> that we’ll be coming back to later in the course.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id9">
<img alt="Spike Frequency Adaptation" src="../_images/spikefreq.png" />
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-text">Evidence of Neuron Memory Based on Spike Frequency</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id9" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In these recordings (from <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.65459">this paper</a>), they’ve injected a constant current into these three different neurons, and recorded their activity.
We can see that rather than outputting a regularly spaced sequence of spikes, there’s an increasing gap between the spikes.
There are various mechanisms underlying this, but essentially it comes down to slower processes that aren’t reset by a spike. Let’s see how we can model that.</p>
<p>Actually there are many, many different models for spike frequency adaptation. We’ll just show one very simple approach, but you can take a look at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Spike_frequency_adaptation">this review</a> if you want some more ideas.</p>
<p>In the simple model <a class="reference internal" href="#memorymodel"><span class="xref myst">here</span></a>, we just introduce a variable threshold represented by the variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_T\)</span>. Each time the neuron spikes, the threshold increases, making it more difficult to fire the next spike, before slowly decaying back to its starting value.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id10">
<img alt="Spike Frequency Adaptation Memory Model" src="../_images/LIFadaptive.png" />
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-text">Spike Frequency Adaptation Memory Model</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the equations, we represent that by having a new exponentially decaying differential equation for the threshold, modifying the threshold condition so that it’s <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v&gt;v_T\)</span> instead of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v&gt;1\)</span>, and specifying that after a spike the threshold should increase by some value. You can see that it does the job, there’s a smaller gap between earlier spikes than later spikes.</p>
<p>In general, spike frequency adaptation can give really rich and powerful dynamics to neurons, but we won’t go into any more detail about that right now.</p>

<h2>Other Abstract Neuron Models<a class="headerlink" href="#other-abstract-neuron-models" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This has been a quick tour of some features of abstract neuron models. There’s a lot more to know about if you want to dive deeper.</p>

<p>Some of the behaviours of real neurons that we haven’t seen in our models so far include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Phasic spiking, i.e. only spiking at the start of an input.</p></li>
<li><p>Bursting, both phasic at the start or tonic ongoing.</p></li>
<li><p>And post-inhibitory rebound, where a neuron fires a spike once an inhibitory or negative current is turned off.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can capture a lot of these effects with two variable models such as the adaptive exponential integrate and fire or Izhikevich neuron models.</p>
<p>There ‘s also stochastic neuron models based either on having a Gaussian noise current or a probabilistic spiking process.</p>
<p>Taking that further there are Markov chain models of neurons where you model the probability of neurons switching between discrete states.</p>
